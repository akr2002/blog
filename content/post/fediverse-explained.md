The internet is dominated by a few giant platforms that control most of the online content and communication. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and others have billions of users who depend on them for social networking, entertainment, news, and more. But what if there was a way to escape the walled gardens of these corporations and join a more open, diverse, and decentralized web? That's where the **Fediverse** comes in.

The Fediverse (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing (i.e. social networking, microblogging, blogging, or websites) and file hosting, which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other¹. The Fediverse is a network of diverse and decentralized platforms that offer users more control over their data, privacy, and online interactions.

## How Does the Fediverse Work?

The Fediverse works by using open communication protocols that allow different software packages to exchange information across servers. These protocols include ActivityPub, Diaspora, OStatus, Zot, and others¹. Each server (also called an instance) hosts a number of user accounts that can create and share content with other accounts on the same or different instances. Users can also follow accounts from other instances and interact with them through comments, likes, reblogs, etc.

The Fediverse is not controlled by any central authority or corporation. Each instance is run by its own administrator who sets the rules and policies for their community. Users can choose an instance that suits their preferences and needs, or even host their own instance if they have the technical skills and resources. This way, the Fediverse fosters diversity, freedom of expression, and self-governance.

## What Can You Do on the Fediverse?

The Fediverse offers a variety of platforms for different purposes and audiences. Some of them are:

- **Mastodon**: A microblogging platform similar to Twitter, where users can post short messages (called toots) with media attachments and hashtags. Mastodon has a unique feature called the local timeline, which shows all the posts from the users on the same instance. Mastodon also supports content warnings, lists, polls, and emoji reactions.
- **Pleroma**: Another microblogging platform that is compatible with Mastodon, but with a smaller server footprint and more customization options. Pleroma also has a rich text editor, chat functionality, and support for multiple accounts.
- **Pixelfed**: A photo-sharing platform similar to Instagram, where users can post images and videos with filters, captions, and mentions. Pixelfed also has features like stories, collections, albums, and discover pages.
- **PeerTube**: A video-sharing platform similar to YouTube, where users can upload and watch videos without ads or tracking. PeerTube uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce bandwidth costs and censorship risks. PeerTube also has features like live streaming, playlists, subtitles, and comments.
- **Friendica**: A social networking platform similar to Facebook, where users can post status updates, photos, events, polls, and more. Friendica also has features like groups, pages, forums, calendars, and contacts.
- **Hubzilla**: A versatile platform that combines social networking, blogging, file storage, wiki editing, and more. Hubzilla also has features like channels, clones, webpages,
nomadic identity⁴, and access control lists.

These are just some examples of the many platforms available on the Fediverse. You can find more platforms on [fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party/), a website that showcases different Fediverse projects.

## How to Join the Fediverse?

To join the Fediverse, you need to choose a platform and an instance that you like. You can browse different instances on [joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/), [the-federation.info](https://the-federation.info/), [fediverse.network](https://fediverse.network/), or [fediscan.xyz](https://fediscan.xyz/). You can also use [trunk.madnificent.space](https://trunk.madnificent.space/) to find people to follow based on your interests.

Once you have chosen an instance, you need to create an account with a username and a password. You will also get a unique identifier that looks like an email address (e.g. @user@instance.tld). This identifier is how you can be found and followed by other users on the Fediverse.

After creating your account, you can start posting content,
following other accounts,
and exploring the Fediverse.

## Why Join the Fediverse?

The Fediverse is a great alternative to mainstream social media platforms that are often plagued by issues like censorship,
surveillance,
monetization,
and centralization.
The Fediverse gives you more choice, control, and creativity over your online presence and interactions. You can join communities that share your values and interests, or create your own. You can also enjoy a more diverse and respectful online environment, where you can learn from different perspectives and cultures.

The Fediverse is also a way to support free and open-source software, which is developed by volunteers and funded by donations. By joining the Fediverse, you are contributing to a more democratic and sustainable web.
